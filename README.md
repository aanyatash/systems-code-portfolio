# Systems Code Portfolio
This is a snapshot of code I wrote when working on bare metal (build libraries for a Raspberry Pi). Includes code for printf library, a keyboard driver, and a shell. This also includes a folder containing all components of a group project to make a Persistance Of Vision Globe. My code contributions to the project are detailed in the ReadME file in the folder.
