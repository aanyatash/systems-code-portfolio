# Systems Code Portfolio
This is a snapshot of code I wrote when working on bare metal (build libraries for a Raspberry Pi). Includes code for printf library, a keyboard driver, and a shell. This also includes a folder containing all components of a group project to make a Persistance Of Vision Globe. My code contributions to the project are detailed in the ReadME file in the folder.

The code is from a Stanford class entitled CS 107E: Computer Systems From the Ground Up. The course description is as follows:

Introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer systems through bare metal programming on the Raspberry Pi. Explores how five concepts come together in computer systems: hardware, architecture, assembly code, the C language, and software development tools. Students do all programming with a Raspberry Pi kit and several add-ons (LEDs, buttons). Topics covered include: the C programming language, data representation, machine-level code, computer arithmetic, compilation, memory organization and management, debugging, hardware, and I/O.
